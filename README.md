# SensorFusion

Lightweight Arduino Sensor Fusion library (Mahony + Madgwick) with a small demo.

This repository contains a compact implementation that merges ideas from Madgwick and Mahony AHRS algorithms and provides a simple C++ class `SF` you can include in Arduino sketches. It computes a quaternion-based orientation from raw gyroscope, accelerometer and optional magnetometer data.

Contents
- `src/` - library source (`SensorFusion.h`, `SensorFusion.cpp`)
- `examples/` - example sketches (existing MPU/STM32 example and a new XIAO ESP32-S3 demo)
- `extras/` - small utilities and images
- `library.properties`, `keywords.txt` - Arduino library metadata

Quick summary
- Two sensor fusion algorithms are implemented: Mahony (faster, works without magnetometer) and Madgwick (more accurate when magnetometer available).
- API: create an `SF fusion;` object, call `fusion.deltatUpdate()` every loop to get the delta time, then call either `fusion.MahonyUpdate(...)` or `fusion.MadgwickUpdate(...)`. Read euler angles with `fusion.getPitch()/getRoll()/getYaw()` or the radians variants.

How to build and run (Arduino IDE)
1. Install board support for your target board (see board-specific notes below). For a XIAO ESP32-S3 install Espressif/Seeed board support via Boards Manager or PlatformIO.
2. Install any sensor libraries you need (for example `MPU9250` by bolderflight if you use that IMU). The library code in `src/` does not depend on that library.
3. Copy the whole repository into your Arduino `libraries/` folder or use the Arduino Library Manager to add it.
4. Open one of the sketches from `examples/` and upload to your board.

New example: XIAO ESP32-S3
- `examples/Xiao_S3_SensorFusion/Xiao_S3_SensorFusion.ino` is a small, self-contained demo that uses the `SF` API with simulated IMU values. It compiles for XIAO ESP32-S3 and other ESP32 boards out of the box and lets you verify the library is working before wiring real sensors.

Running the library on a Seeed XIAO ESP32-S3 (practical notes)
- Install the appropriate board package (Espressif/Seeed): use the Arduino Boards Manager or PlatformIO. Select the `Seeed XIAO ESP32S3` or compatible board in the Tools ▸ Board menu.
- Make sure you have the required libraries installed if you will use a hardware IMU (for example `MPU9250` by bolderflight). If you only want to test the SensorFusion code, the `Xiao_S3` example uses simulated data and requires no extra libraries.
- Wiring for a typical MPU9250 (I2C): connect VCC to 3.3V, GND to GND, SDA to the XIAO's SDA pin and SCL to the XIAO's SCL pin. Check your board pinout — do not assume pin numbers. If you use SPI, follow your IMU library's example for CS/MISO/MOSI/SCLK pins.

Suggested workflow to get a demo running
1. Open `examples/Xiao_S3_SensorFusion/Xiao_S3_SensorFusion.ino` in the Arduino IDE.
2. Select the XIAO ESP32-S3 board and correct COM port.
3. Upload. The sketch prints roll/pitch/yaw to Serial (115200).
4. To use a real IMU, install the `MPU9250` library, wire the sensor, and replace the simulated sensor-values section in the example with calls to your IMU library (see `examples/MPU9250_SPI_SF/MPU9250_SPI_SF.ino` for a full example using the `MPU9250` library).

Exposure fusion on XIAO (task & next steps)
You mentioned implementing an exposure fusion algorithm on the XIAO and publishing an example on GitHub. Exposure fusion requires a camera (or multiple images) and enough RAM/processing power to hold and blend those images. A few important clarifying questions before I implement this:

1. Do you have a camera module wired to the XIAO S3? If so, which model (OV2640/OV5640/etc.) and how is it connected? The XIAO S3 does not include a native camera interface like the ESP32-CAM; additional hardware or a different board may be needed.
2. Do you want a full multi-exposure HDR-like fusion (several images, weight maps, multi-scale blending) or a simplified one-pass exposure blending (per-pixel weighted average)? The full algorithm is heavier but more photo-accurate.

If you confirm the camera details I will:
- provide a tested implementation plan and a working example sketch (or a cross-compiled helper if the camera/processing requires more resources),
- add the example to `examples/` and document wiring and build steps,
- push the final example and README updates to GitHub when you are ready.

Files of interest (short descriptions)
- `src/SensorFusion.h` - library header. Declares class `SF`, public API functions for Mahony/Madgwick updates, getters for Euler angles and quaternion.
- `src/SensorFusion.cpp` - implementation of the algorithms, quaternion math, and fast inverse-square-root. This is the core algorithmic code.
- `examples/MPU9250_SPI_SF/MPU9250_SPI_SF.ino` - working example with the `MPU9250` library (SPI). Shows how to read IMU, pass values in SI units (m/s^2 and rad/s) and print Euler angles using `Streaming` macros.
- `examples/SensorFusion/SensorFusion.ino` - a minimal usage example (non-working placeholder) showing the API calls.

Contact / License
This code is originally derived from Madgwick/Mahony implementations (open-source). Check the original authors for license details. The repository includes the original comments and attribution.

If you want, I can now:
- (A) add a practical XIAO example that reads a real MPU9250 over I2C and prints angles, or
- (B) begin a camera-based exposure fusion implementation — but I need your camera model & wiring details first.

Next steps: tell me whether you prefer (A) or (B) and if (B) provide camera details. I already added a new XIAO demo that compiles on ESP32 and verifies the fusion code.
